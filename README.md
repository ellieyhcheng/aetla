# Aetla

College planning made simple. Forget pen and paper, plan your college years the modern way with Aetla. With course information, filtered majors, and drag and drop functionality, it is the easy way to make a plan for your curriculum.

Aetla only supports UCLA right now. In the future, it may broaden its scope, but the goal of the team is to fully develop the web app for a more complete and smooth user experience. We apologize for the inconvenience and disappointment.

If your major(s) is not listed, just submit the contact form and we'll add it as soon as possible. Thank you for your patience.
